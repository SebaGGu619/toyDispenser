# toyDispenser

Toy dispenser that gives out cute small robots. Was created for Flight Festival 2020 edition.

# Idea:

- The carousel STL has holes that are populated with one toy each.
- At every few degress of rotation one toy falls out of the hole.
- The bottom motorized part STL has been lost to time but the idea is stil here.
- Code for the arduino that used a ultrasonic sensor for hand detection has been provided as well.
